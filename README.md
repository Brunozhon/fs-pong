## Installation

Good luck with this one. I'm not an expert at writing this part.

## Overall Rating of F#

:star: :star: ⚫ ⚫ ⚫

It's a Microsoft version of [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), and I'm not a fan of OCaml-like languages.

## Comparison to JavaScript

The JavaScript version took 142 lines of code, but this version only took 104 lines of code.
